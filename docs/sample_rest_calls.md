# A couple of handy API REST calls

## Jenkins

https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/computer/api/json?tree=computer[displayName]

{"computer":[{"displayName":"master"},{"displayName":"celery"},{"displayName":"remote-slave-3"},{"displayName":"remote-slave-6"},{"displayName":"remote-slave-7"},{"displayName":"remote-slave-8"}]}

://ci.jenkins-ci.org/api/json?tree=jobs[name,color,buildable,healthReport[description,score,iconUrl],builds[changeSet[items[msg,user]]]]

This query gives the following things:

The job name and colour, which are self explanatory.
The healthReport, which contains useful information like how many tests are passing/exist for projects that create xunit reports. It also includes coverage statistics for python projects. Generating coverage reports with PHPUnit is unreasonably slow for the whole application, so weâ€™ve turned it off.
The builds key contains a list of the changeSets with the messages and user who did the change set. This is used to blame people when they inevitably break the build.
